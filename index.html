  <section>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>Tab Group Booker</strong> browser extension handles data. The extension is designed to operate locally within your browser and does not collect or transmit personal or sensitive user data to external servers.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What the extension does</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Detects Chrome <em>tab groups</em> and their member tabs within your browser.</li>
      <li>Creates bookmark folders on your device (Bookmarks Bar) and saves links of tabs that belong to a selected tab group.</li>
      <li>Adds a right-click (context menu) entry to let you bookmark a tab group quickly.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data collection and use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No external data collection:</strong> The extension does <strong>not</strong> send any browsing information, bookmarks, tab titles, URLs, or other data to any remote server or third party.</li>
      <li><strong>Local-only operations:</strong> All functionality (reading tabs, detecting groups, creating bookmarks) runs locally in the browser using Chrome's extension APIs.</li>
      <li><strong>No analytics or tracking:</strong> The extension does not include analytics, crash reporting, or telemetry services.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Permissions used</h2>
    <p>The extension requests the following permissions so it can provide its functionality. These are used only locally within your browser:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>tabs</strong> — to read open tabs and their URLs/titles so they can be bookmarked.</li>
      <li><strong>tabGroups</strong> — to detect and identify tab groups for bookmarking.</li>
      <li><strong>bookmarks</strong> — to create bookmark folders and add bookmarks to them.</li>
      <li><strong>contextMenus</strong> — to add a right-click menu item that triggers the bookmark action.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Remote code</h2>
    <p>This extension does not load or execute remote code. All JavaScript files are included with the extension package and run locally. If remote code execution were introduced in future versions, it would be clearly disclosed in the extension's listing and privacy policy.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Third parties</h2>
    <p>The extension does not share data with third parties. There are no third-party SDKs, analytics, or ad networks embedded.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>Since no data is collected or transmitted by the extension, there is nothing retained by the developer. Bookmarks created by the extension remain in the browser's bookmark storage (managed by you and Chrome) and are not accessible to the extension author.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>User controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can remove or disable the extension at any time via <code>chrome://extensions</code> (or your browser's extension manager).</li>
      <li>Bookmarks created by the extension are ordinary browser bookmarks — you can edit or delete them in Chrome's Bookmark Manager.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>

    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or the extension, contact: <a class="contact" href="mailto:tanmaydhelia.labs@gmail.com">Email</a></p>
